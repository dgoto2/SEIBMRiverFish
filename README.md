# SEIBMRiverFish
A spatially explicit (1D) individual-based model for shovelnose sturgeon populations in a tributary of the Missouri River system

## Description 
SEIBMRiverFish is a spatially explicit, indvidual-based model designed to simulate population dynamics of shovelnose sturgeon via individual-based processes including movement, foraging, growth, metabolism, maturation, reproduction, and mortality in a large river system.
